				<h2>About Us:</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="bodytext">
				<p>Hot Beans Web was founded in the autumn of 2003, by our creator, George Davidson. It was his goal to design a 
				website development company to provide others with a way to take their business online. It was his passion and 
				hardwork that encouraged others like him to come together and collaborate to make the company the great thing it
				is today. The purpose of the company is to allow any one person, or business, to have their own website where they
				can begin selling anything their heart desires. We will work tirelessly to provide a site to our clients in the
				exact way they want, communication between the designer and the customer is vital to obtain the information needed
				to bring the client's vision to life.</p>

					<p>Hot Beans Web is situated in King's Lynn. We take pride in having our main headquarters being in this enclosed, but wonderful
					town because of the small population, this means that we are required to get to know our local customers to a personal and very
					friendly level. The reclusivness of the town allows us to work in peace and expand our business remotely, focusing our growth into
					the online world instead. Using the map provided to the right, customers can follow the directions and come see us in person. We are
					open to people coming in and visiting us, we encourage questions and meetings can be arranged with ease. There are lots of staff members (check out 
					our Trainee Profiles page to get a closer look at the type of people you could be speaking to today!) who are willing to assist you with 
					every enquiry and solve all of your problems, no matter how big or small. We are proud of what we do and will strive to ensure that our 
					customers do too. So, come down to our headquarters and speak with one of our professionals today! </p>
